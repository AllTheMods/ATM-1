		Thaumcraft-1.10.2-6.0.BETA5.jar:
			6.0.BETA5
			- The full, not fractional amount of observations, theories and epiphanies are now spent when completing research. Oops.
			- golems now operate within 32 blocks instead of 16.
			- provider seals no longer require golems to be especially smart to listen to them, but they still require biothaumic mind research
			- fixed focus crash in NEI
			- fixed wrong import causing crash during focus creation for those without the correct java library
			- fixed "phantom" taint seed issue
			- fixed crash when placing arcane bore
			- research entries requiring enchantments are now a lot less picky
			- loads of other small tweaks and bugfixes
		Thaumcraft-1.10.2-6.0.BETA4.jar:
			6.0.BETA4
			- workbench charger can now be placed on a focal manipulator as well
			- changed the way and exact point when vis consumption is calculated for foci. Vis should no longer be consumed if an effect does not trigger.
			- added 'Burst'focus modifier
			- added 'Plan' focus medium
			- added 'Quicken'focus medium
			- completely overhauled the way foci effect links are created and managed behind the scenes. Much more interesting combos are now possible. Chaining+Bursting+Scattering Fireballs anyone?
			- API: Caster focus API has undergone massive changes, but it should be a lot easier to create focus effects now. Much of the grunt work is handled by the casting engine behind the scenes instead of having to be coded per effect.
			- increased focus effect damage across the board to be more inline with vanilla damage numbers
			- break focus will no longer break unbreakable blocks clientside
			- 'break' focus effect now takes block hardness into account and will take longer to break harder blocks. Potency increases the breaking speed.
			- fixed shardFire oredictionary entry to actually refer to fire crystals and not air crystals
			- theorycrafting research entry now has two stages as intended.
			- added a 'scrap theory' button to research table if you want to start from scratch
			- fixed a few theorycraft cards that could give infinite draws or progress
			- rebalanced theorycraft cards with item costs so they offer greater rewards
			- jars can now be filled all the way from alembics
			- arcane ear (toggle) should now be craftable
			- fixed various broken research entries
			- fixed researches requiring thaumium to be unlocked
			- improved the range of the touch focus
			- sword of the zephyr once again has the winds effect
			- improved taint fibre hitboxes
			- fixed taint fibres having a 50% chance to spread even if no flux was present in aura
			- all types of taint growth now costs a tiny amount of flux to occur.
			- taint seeds will now take damage if no flux is present
			- rebalanced the way aura and flux spreads between chunks. The math was a bit off and could force too much vis into a chunk which in turn caused flux.
			- added functionality that will automatically throttle the number of particles thaumcraft generates when fps drops below 30
		Thaumcraft-1.10.2-6.0.BETA3.jar:
			6.0.BETA3
			- fixed a major bug that was causing certain items (usually vis crystals) to have their stack size set to 1 the first time their aspect values where calculated.
			- fixed gauntlet moddel clipping issues
			- wand hud element should no longer be upside down if shown on the bottom of the screen
			- fixed research page formatting so that elements like line breaks, page breaks, etc. are properly rendered on all machines. For lots of people it was just displaying walls of unformatted text.
			- removed a few possible infinite loops causing research to freeze and eventually crash the client
			- fixed occasional text overlap on knowledge types research entry
			- fix for boss health bars not displaying during fight and only appearing after death
			- fix vis discount items in the newer bauble slots not being counted
			- essentia in crucibles will now keep slowly dissolving if no heat is applied
			- fixed custom armor model rotation points
			- fixed arcane ear note display and added another version of the arcane ear that toggles on / off instead of sending a pulse
			- removing a focus with sneak+f while wearing a focus pouch in your belt slot will now properly update the pouch contents clientside

			- fixed exchange focus localization and spam casting that occurred when you selected a block
