		AppleCore-mc1.10.2-3.1.0.jar:
			Added some features to the API related to block-based foods:

			 * Added IEdibleBlock with methods to control whether or not Block-based foods can be eaten at max hunger (like ItemFood.alwaysEdible) 
			 * AppleCore implements IEdibleBlock on BlockCake at runtime, so you can make it always edible by doing `((IEdibleBlock) Blocks.cake).setEdibleAtMaxHunger(true)` 
			 * Added IAppleCoreRegistry (AppleCoreAPI.registry) to register Block <-> Item relationships for Block-based foods that don't use an ItemBlock (e.g. cake)

		AppleCore-mc1.10.2-3.0.0.jar:
			 * Breaking API change: Removed FertilizationEvent entirely 
			 * This event and the ASM required for it has been a constant source of hard-to-debug errors and it isn't worth the effort to maintain 
			 * As far as I'm aware this event has never been used by any mod that depends on AppleCore, so upgrading shouldn't affect any current AppleCore users 
			 * Added zh_TW translation (thanks hugoalh)
