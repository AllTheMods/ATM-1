	Practical Logistics 2 (went from PracticalLogistics2-1.10.2-2.0.2 to PracticalLogistics2-1.10.2-2.0.3):
		PracticalLogistics2-1.10.2-2.0.3:
			This version of PL2 enables compatibility with the latest Sonar Core but no changes have been made to PL2.

			I am currently working on a port/rewrite to 1.12.2 which will probably be renamed PL3.

			Once this new version is complete it may be moved to 1.10.2, but for now you can consider PL2 1.10.2 dead.

	Sonar Core (went from Sonar-Core-1.10.2-3.3.0 to Sonar-Core-1.10.2-3.3.1):
		Sonar-Core-1.10.2-3.3.1:
			This is a back-port from the 1.12.2 Version of Sonar Core.
			Here is a list of all changes backported, some of which may not be relevant.

			Changes
			- Removed IC2 api.
			- Increased Inventory Handling efficiency.
			- Uniformed Sonar Core block registering.

			Fixes
			- Fixes crash exporting items from machines.
			- Fixes AE2 Crash on load.
			- Fixes "IllegalReferenceCountException" crashes/lag relating to Packets on servers.
			- Fixes crashes when charging energy items in Mekanism Energy Cubes and other blocks
			- Fixes machines losing their NBT Tags when rotated.
			- Fixes to AE2 Compatibility with Fluids and Inventories.
			- Fixes massive lag with Storage Chambers and Reinforced Chests
			- Fixes Stable Stone not sharing the blast resistance of reinforced stone.

		Thaumcraft-1.10.2-6.0.BETA7.jar:
			6.0.BETA7
			- API: removed crystal shard ore dictionary entries for now. Turns out forge oredict doesn't account for nbt data.
			- dioptra can now be toggled between showing vis and flux and improved the comparator output as well. I forgot to add this to the beta 6 patch notes when it was actually changed
			- added potion sprayer
			- rebalanced focus medium vis values slightly
			- fixed focus bolt fx
			- re-added the quicken focus mod which mysteriously dissapeared from my code at some point
			- chain focus mod and arcing enchantment will no longer target things you are riding or players and creatures on your team or that you own. They may still hit something by mistake if it is in the way
			- prevent onBlockHarvested from being called twice by golems and break focus which was causing a dupe bug on some blocks like skulls
			- everfull urn is now obtainable much earlier
			- triple meat treat regen effect now last the proper amount of time
			- infusion is now unlocked as its own research and not part of unlocking artifice anymore.
			- many theorycraft cards that consumed items no longer do so.
			- rebalanced theorycards in general so that there are easy, medium and hard choices - easy choices have no requisites, but give little progress (~10). Medium gives better progress (~25), but requires something simple to do. Hard choices give a lot of progress (~30-50), but also requires more effort
			- instead of the highest category in theorycrafting getting a bonus, all other categories now get a penalty instead

			- potions and related items now have most of their aspects calculated from the ingredients used to craft them
			- fixed dust crafting related crash with crucibles
